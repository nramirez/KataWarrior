## Kata Warrior

This is a chrome extension to avoid distractions.

I'm a big fan of Codewars. It helps me improve my programming knowledge, and stay sharp on things I already know and don't want to forget. On the other hand, I also get easily distracted by social media, and news sites such as reddit.

Kata Warrior helps avoiding these automatic fb/twitter/reddit interactions by forcing the user to complete a kata to have access to a period of free time.

A big part of my inspirations came from Strict workflow, an awesome extension that uses the  pomodoro technique.

## Install the extension

Check out how to load the extension in the [official documentation site](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) 

## Getting started with the warrior way

* After installing the extension click on options 
	(In the future this should be accessible from the tab button in the upper right)
* Write your Codewars username.
* Write the break time that you deserve after completing a kata, for me is 15 minutes (5 minutes of fb/twitter/instagram and 1 or 2 chess games :bowtie:).
* Add to the list of distractions the sites that make you waste your time the most.

If you have any suggestion don't hesitate and let me know. Happy Coding!!

Note: This won't stop you from wasting your time, but It will remind you that a real warrior first gets the job done and then takes the rest that he deserves. :sunglasses:
